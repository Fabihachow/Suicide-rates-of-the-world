# Suicide rates of the world

In this repository you will be able to find the sad truth of the world. 

The meaning of suicide is the act or an instance of ending one's own life voluntarily and intentionally.
\
This occurs when someone's mental health has been so atrocious that it will unfortunately lead them to take away their own life.

This is why it's so important to take care of their mental health it  should come first in everyone's life.

Here we are exploring the data of W.H.O ( The world health organization) https://data.who.int/indicators/i/F08B4FD/16BBF41?m49=124 .

We will be able to see how suicide is affecting its population around the globe. 

We will also see the year that the rates peaked the most.

We will see which age group it is affecting the most.

What about our own country it's not easy but it's here too and affecting a lot of people.

You will be able to see this in my repository.
